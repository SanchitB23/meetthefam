# Auth + Row-Level Security

## Auth mechanisms

- **Email magic link** — primary login + signup. No password fields.
- **Google OAuth** — secondary, one-click.
- No password-reset flows because there are no passwords. See [`../adrs/0004-magic-link-only-no-passwords.md`](../adrs/0004-magic-link-only-no-passwords.md).

## Session management

- Supabase session lives in a secure `httpOnly` cookie, set by `@supabase/ssr`.
- Server Components and Server Actions read the session via `createServerClient(...)` from `@supabase/ssr`. **In Next.js 16 `cookies()` and `headers()` from `next/headers` are async** — every server-side Supabase client must `await` them when wiring the cookie adapter. Use Context7 MCP for the current snippet.
- Client Components that need the session use `createBrowserClient(...)`.

## Auth boundary — `proxy.ts`, not `middleware.ts`

Phase 1 introduces the auth gate that protects `/dashboard`, `/tree/*`, etc. **Use `proxy.ts` at the repo root, not `middleware.ts`.** Reasons:

- Next.js 16 deprecated `middleware.ts` in favor of `proxy.ts` to make the network boundary explicit.
- `proxy.ts` runs on the Node.js runtime — required for `@supabase/ssr` (Edge runtime can't reach our Supabase URL with full functionality).
- The exported function is `proxy`, not `middleware`. Same `NextRequest` / `NextResponse` API.

```ts
// proxy.ts
import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'

export async function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  // ...refresh session, redirect unauthenticated traffic to /login
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!_next|.*\\..*|share).*)'],  // skip /share/[token] — auth not required there
}
```

See [`../adrs/0007-nextjs-16-and-async-idioms.md`](../adrs/0007-nextjs-16-and-async-idioms.md) for the broader rationale.

## Auth UI

- **Custom form**, not `@supabase/auth-ui-react`. The prebuilt component is dated and hard to style; a custom form is ~50 lines and matches the rest of the app.

## Row-Level Security (RLS) — multi-tenancy enforcement

RLS policies are the single source of truth for "who can read / write what." Every table has RLS enabled. Below is the policy intent — actual SQL lives in `supabase/migrations/` once Phase 0 lands.

### `trees`

```
SELECT  → caller owns the tree, OR caller is in tree_members for it
UPDATE  → caller owns the tree
DELETE  → caller owns the tree
INSERT  → caller is the owner_id (you can only create trees you own)
```

### `tree_members`

```
SELECT  → caller is the user_id of the row, OR caller owns the tree
INSERT  → caller owns the tree
UPDATE  → caller owns the tree (changing roles)
DELETE  → caller owns the tree, OR caller is the user_id (leaving the tree)
```

### `people`

```
SELECT  → caller owns the tree OR is a member of it
INSERT  → caller is owner or editor on the tree
UPDATE  → caller is owner or editor on the tree
DELETE  → caller is owner or editor on the tree
```

### `profiles`

```
SELECT  → public (so we can show display_name / avatar of any user shown in members list)
INSERT  → caller is creating their own row (caller.id = profiles.id)
UPDATE  → caller is updating their own row
DELETE  → caller is deleting their own row
```

### Storage (the `photos` bucket)

```
SELECT (read)   → public reads (the photo URL itself is unguessable; we accept that trade-off)
INSERT          → caller is owner or editor on the tree referenced in the path prefix
UPDATE          → same
DELETE          → same
```

The path convention `trees/<tree_id>/people/<person_id>/avatar.jpg` lets the storage policy parse the tree_id from the path and check membership. See [`photo-upload.md`](photo-upload.md).

## Read-only share link — bypasses RLS

`/share/[token]` is a Route Handler that uses the **`service_role`** Supabase key (server-only env var, never exposed to the client). With service_role, RLS is bypassed.

The 256-bit random `share_token` *is* the credential. The handler:

1. Reads the token from the URL.
2. `SELECT * FROM trees WHERE share_token = $1` — if no row, return 404.
3. `SELECT * FROM people WHERE tree_id = <found-tree-id>`.
4. Renders `<FamilyTree>` in read-only mode.

See [`share-link.md`](share-link.md) for token generation, regeneration, and revocation.

## Testing RLS — non-skippable

Every multi-tenant SaaS gets bitten by RLS holes. Per the spec's testing strategy, RLS tests are the **one tier we don't skip**:

- User A creates a tree with people.
- User B (not a member) is verified to be unable to SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE any of A's rows.
- User C (an editor) is verified to be unable to UPDATE the tree's `owner_id` or membership rows.

These live in Vitest + a Supabase test client (uses three separate user sessions to simulate roles).
